What's in here?
---------------

While the utilities in this repository provide functionality similar to some of
that found the Standard Template Library, there should be no duplication.
For example, the `Array` class found here provides a subset of the
functionality of `std::vector`, with the exception that it allows allocation of
elements within it without initialization/construction.
